This class was written to provide Java's ByteBuffer functionality in many of my internal C++ projects. The code was recently rewritten and may contain bugs! Feel free to make any suggestions for improving the code or request any features that could be beneficial to a variety of applications that may use this class.

Why Byte Buffer?
-Relative and Absolute get() & put() methods
-Easier to work with than a raw byte array
-Read and Write large amounts of data
-Easy way to manipulate or create custom data structures

Example usage scenarios
-HTTP: Request & Response parsers
-Packets: Parse or Create custom packets to send over the network in a quick and easy manner
